# CDC Pact
- **Pact** is a consumer-driven contract testing framework. 
Born out of a microservices boom, Pact was created to solve the problem of integration testing large, distributed systems.
(Old definition)
- Rescue for integration test cost.  
- Implement any programming language you want. [For example](https://docs.pact.io/implementation_guides/cli)
- No dedicated test environments (it works on dev machine)
- A contract between a consumer and provider is called a **pact**. Each pact is a
  collection of **interactions**. (expected request, minimal expected response)

- Remember that pact is for testing the contract used for communication, and not for
  testing particular UI behaviour or business logic.

     >**Unit tests** are typically test a single function or method call.     
     **Service tests** are designed to bypass the user interface and test services directly.     
     **End-to-end tests** are tests run against your entire system
