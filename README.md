# CDC Pact

- **Pact** is a consumer-driven contract testing framework. Born out of a microservices boom, Pact was created to solve
  the problem of integration testing large, distributed systems.
  (Old definition)
- Rescue for integration test cost.
- Implement any programming language you want. [For example](https://docs.pact.io/implementation_guides/cli)
- No dedicated test environments (it works on dev machine)
- A contract between a consumer and provider is called a **pact**. Each pact is a collection of **interactions**. (
  expected request, minimal expected response)

- Remember that pact is for testing the contract used for communication, and not for testing particular UI behaviour or
  business logic.

  > **Unit tests** are typically test a single function or method call.     
  **Service tests** are designed to bypass the user interface and test services directly.     
  **End-to-end tests** are tests run against your entire system

# Matching

## Matching on types

`dsl.Like(content)` tells Pact that value is not important, just focus type match.

## Matching on arrays

`dsl.EachLike(content, min)` tells Pact that the value should be array type, consisting of elements like those passed
in. `min` must be >= 1.

```
"fabrics": dsl.EachLike(dsl.MapMatcher{
    "title":    dsl.Like("Pamuk"),
    "count":    dsl.Integer()
}, 1),
```

## Matching by regular expression

`dsl.Term(example, matcher)` tells Pact that the value should match using a given regular expression, using example in
mock responses.

`"type": Term("admin", "admin|user|guest")` => "type": "admin"

## Match common formats

| method          | description                                                                                     |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Identifier()`  | Match an ID (e.g. 42)                                                                           |
| `Integer()`     | Match all numbers that are integers (both ints and longs)                                       |
| `Decimal()`     | Match all real numbers (floating point and decimal)                                             |
| `HexValue()`    | Match all hexadecimal encoded strings                                                           |
| `Date()`        | Match string containing basic ISO8601 dates (e.g. 2016-01-01)                                   |
| `Timestamp()`   | Match a string containing an RFC3339 formatted timestapm (e.g. Mon, 31 Oct 2016 15:21:41 -0400) |
| `Time()`        | Match string containing times in ISO date format (e.g. T22:44:30.652Z)                          |
| `IPv4Address()` | Match string containing IP4 formatted address                                                   |
| `IPv6Address()` | Match string containing IP6 formatted address                                                   |
| `UUID()`        | Match strings containing UUIDs                                                                  |
